# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview
Student Worker Task Tracker

On budget-conscious university and college campuses, many jobs are filled by student workers who perform important tasks that are essential to maintaining a functioning and thriving campus, from assisting in administrative offices, helping to maintain research labs, to monitoring library study rooms, among countless other roles. Typically, a faculty and/or staff member supervises students—often several students at a time with varying schedules—juggling this supervision alongside many other responsibilities. As a result, faculty/staff supervisors struggle to keep track of tasks and monitor completion. Also, students, who often work alone, do not receive the information they need to do their work. The whole process can be frustrating, inefficient, and riddled with miscommunication. 

This application helps supervisors and students organize and complete required tasks seamlessly and effectively. Using authenticated user accounts, the application allows supervisors to tailor a flexible task list for each student. The supervisor can create tasks and add/remove them to/from the student’s task list. Students can mark tasks complete, stamp them with a date and time, and provide feedback. Sorting features make it possible to review tasks and their completion dates. To help motivate students, a “surprise” design element appears once a task is marked completed. The application records, quantifies, and incentivizes accomplished work, which helps supervisors, students, and the school create a more effective and satisfying work experience.

### Features
•	Supervisors and students can create and authenticate accounts.
•	Supervisors can use CRUD functionality for managing task list.
•	Students can enter whether task is complete, date/time stamp when task completed, record how long it took to complete task, and add comments/feedback.
•	Supervisors and students can search all tasks.
•	Supervisors and students can sort tasks by date/time to track frequency and need of completion.

### Technologies
•	C#
•	.NET
•	mySQL
•	Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn
•	I would like to limit supervisors to task creation/deletion/update/addition. I will need to review how authentication is used to control this functionality.
•	I would like to incentivize task completion by rewarding student with a “surprise” design element when task is marked complete and date/time stamp is entered. A random image may require an API or a function that randomizes a collection of images. I am exploring options.
